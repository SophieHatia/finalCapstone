# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

In this project I created an algorithm for analysing the sentiments of reviews of amazon products using Natural Language Processing. I read in a dataset of amazon reviews for a product and then cleaned the data by ensuring it was all lowercase and removing the unimportant and filler words so that it would be able to be analysed better. I then used the python package spacytextblob in order to analyse whether the review was positive or negative.
