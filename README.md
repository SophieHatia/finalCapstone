## Description
In this project I created an algorithm for analysing the sentiments of reviews of amazon products using Natural Language Processing. I read in a dataset of amazon reviews for a product and then cleaned the data by ensuring it was all lowercase and removing the unimportant and filler words so that it would be able to be analysed better. I then used the python package spacytextblob in order to analyse whether the review was positive or negative.

## Installation
1. Install SpaCy into python (pip install spacy)
2. Download the small english language package (python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm)
3. Install pandas onto python (pip install pandas)

## User
Run the programme chosing the sample reviews that you would like to analyse
